          <p class="p3" style="text-align: left;">It is extremely difficult to succeed long term in trading. In fact, according to a 2014 University of California study (<a href="https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/papers/Day%20Traders/Day%20Trading%20and%20Learning%20110217.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Do Day Traders Rationally Learn About Their Ability?</a>), the majority of
            traders will fail. Michael Patak, founder and CEO of Topstep Trading, is well aware of the high rate of
            failure in the industry—early in his career <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGbZ-GRyEyE&amp;skip_registered_account_check=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he lost three separate $30,000 trading accounts</a>.</p>
          <p class="p3" style="text-align: left;">Topstep was created to fund and educate traders through a “learn by
            doing” approach in a simulated futures trading environment. Because it is a simulated environment, a
            substantial portion of the risk of live markets is mitigated.</p>
          <p class="p3" style="text-align: left;">While the simulated environment of Topstep removes a substantial
            portion of risk, we still want you to be aware of the risk that comes with trading.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Once you leave simulated trading and get into a live trading environment (whether
            through a Topstep funded account or otherwise), always bear in mind the following:</p>

          <ul class="ul1" style="text-align: left;">
            <li class="li8"><span class="s5"><b>Never risk more than you are willing to lose. Remember that losses are
                  rarely limited to the funds in your accounts – it is possible to lose more than in is in your account
                  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> then be legally responsible for any
                  deficiency.</b></span></li>
            <li class="li8"><span class="s5">Short term trading can be extremely risky. Losses can happen fast, so you
                should not risk money that you can’t afford to lose. No matter how confident you are in your trading
                strategy or system, losses can and will happen. You should always be prepared for this
                possibility.</span></li>
            <li class="li8"><span class="s5">For that reason, never fund short term or leveraged trading activities with
                retirement accounts, student loans proceeds, second mortgages, emergency funds, or funds set aside for
                education, home ownership, living expenses etc.</span></li>
          </ul>

          <p class="p3" style="text-align: left;">Please never place a trade in a live trading environment unless you
            fully understand and accept all the risks that come with it.</p>

          <p class="p3" style="text-align: left;">Futures trading contains substantial risk and is not for every
            investor. An investor could potentially lose all or more than the investor’s initial investment. Only risk
            capital—money that can be lost without jeopardizing one’s financial security or lifestyle—should be used for
            trading and only those individuals with sufficient risk capital should consider trading. Nothing contained
            herein is a solicitation or an offer to buy or sell futures, options, or forex. Past performance is not
            necessarily indicative of future results.</p>
          <p class="p3" style="text-align: left;">CCFTC Rule 4.41 – Hypothetical or Simulated performance results have
            certain limitations. Unlike an actual performance record, simulated results do not represent actual trading.
            Also, because the trades have not actually been executed, the results may have under-or-over compensated for
            the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity. Simulated trading programs, in
            general, are also subject to the fact that they are designed with the benefit of hindsight. No
            representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profit or losses similar to those
            shown.</p>
          <p class="p3" style="text-align: left;">**Topstep deeply cares about traders becoming the best they can be. We
            understand trading has highs and lows and that the majority of traders will fail. We started Topstep to give
            traders a place to learn about trading without the high risk of a live trading environment. Let&#8217;s all
            help the trading community be the best they can be and support each other to help each other know when to
            say stop.</p>
