              the functioning of a real market. Taking advantage of the simulated environment to gain an edge in the

              sooner. Traders are only permitted to trade permitted products by Topstep. For more information, please
              visit our help center here</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excessive or unrealistic single day trades or
              single trade profits will be subject to review by Topstep for any possible violations of these Terms or
              Trading Rules or engaging in any Prohibited Conduct or Prohibited Uses.</span></p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, to deter and avoid violations of
              the trading rules (as set forth in this Section 26 and in addition the Express Funded Account
              Agreement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">), your positions will automatically be flattened (e.g.,
              closed out) just prior to the end of the then current trading session (e.g., about ten seconds prior to
              the closing bell at 3:10 PM CT) as determined by Topstep.</span></p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Topstep, in its sole discretion, determines a
              User has violated any Trading Rules or engaged in Prohibited Conduct, Topstep may, in its sole
              determination, remove any Simulated Account profits, delete a trading day, reset an Account, or ban a User
              from any further use of the Site and Services.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">If Topstep
              identifies trading activity that, in its sole discretion, relates to Prohibited Conduct, Topstep reserves
              the right to, in its sole discretion, delete the trading day and all profits, or restart or close the
              Account. Additionally, Topstep may ban User from use of all or a portion of the Sites and Services.</span>
          </p>
          <h2 class="p4" style="text-align: left;">27. Other Prohibited Uses</h2>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are solely responsible for any and all acts
              and omissions that occur under your Account, and you agree not to engage in unacceptable use of the Sites
              or Services or any User Content including:</span></p>
          <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Posting, storing, or
                disseminating any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, junk mail, spam, chain
                letters or other fraudulent schemes, or any other form of solicitation; </span></li>
          </ul>
          <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using any manual or automated
                software, devices, or other processes to “crawl” or “spider” any web pages contained in the Sites or
                Services; </span></li>
          </ul>
          <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using the Sites or Services to

                affiliates; and</span></li>

          <h2 class="p4" style="text-align: left;">28. Rewards</h2>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to incentive healthier trading habits
              and utilization of Topstep’s educational materials, Topstep may provide certain prizes, rewards, or
              incentives from time to time (each, a “Reward” and collectively, “Rewards”).</span><span
              style="font-weight: 400;"> No Reward shall require any separate or specific fees or payments. Each Reward
              offered from time to time may have specific goals, rules, metrics, delivery or payment terms, and
              expiration dates applicable to such Reward. User is responsible for tracking each Reward and their
              eligibility for achieving such Reward. Each Reward with an expiration date will automatically be of no
              value or effect upon its stated expiration. Rewards are personal to a given User and are non-transferrable
              for any reason. Any redemption of a Reward is final and nonrefundable for any reason. Each Reward offered
              may only be earned by a User one time per Account. Each User is solely responsible for tracking their
              progress toward an achievement and Topstep has no obligation or responsibility to notify a User that a
              Reward eligibility has been achieved.</span></p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to be eligible to participate in earning
              Rewards, a User must (i) have an active Funded Account or Trading Combine that has not been purchased or
              opened with any credits or rewards offered by Topstep or its Affiliates, including any Rewards, and (ii)
              be a U.S. citizen or legal U.S. resident 18 years old or older and cannot be listed on the OFAC Specially
              Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (or other similar list or designation).</span></p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Topstep may prohibit any User or potential User
              from participating in a given Reward, if, at the sole discretion of Topstep, (i) such person shows a
              disregard for these Terms, (ii) acts with an intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass any other User,
              Topstep, or its agents or representatives, (iii) disparages Topstep or its products or services, Topstep’s
              competitors or their products or services, Topstep Affiliates or any other person or party affiliated with
              Topstep, or (iv) acts in any other disruptive manner. Topstep may, for no consideration and without any
              notice to a User, alter or cancel any Reward earned by such User that Topstep deems to have violated these
              Terms, regardless of if such activity was or was not related to earning such Reward. Topstep’s decisions,
              in its sole discretion, as to all matters related to Rewards are final.</span></p>
          <p class="p3" style="text-align: left;"><b style="font-size: 2rem; text-transform: uppercase;">29. Other
              Important Terms</b></p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">These Terms are in addition to any other
              agreements between you and Topstep:</span></p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing in these Terms shall create or be deemed
              to create a partnership, agency, trust arrangement, fiduciary relationship, or joint venture between you
              and Topstep. Neither you nor Topstep shall have any right, power, or authority to act or create any
              obligation, express or implied, on behalf of the other party.</span></p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You agree that breach of the provisions of these
              Terms would cause irreparable harm and significant injury to Topstep which would be both difficult to
              ascertain and which would not be compensable by damages alone. As such, you agree that Topstep has the
              right to enforce the provisions of these Terms by injunction (without necessity of posting bond), specific
              performance, or other equitable relief without prejudice to any other rights and remedies Topstep may have
              for your breach of these Terms.</span></p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We reserve the right at any time in our sole
              discretion to: modify, suspend, or discontinue our Sites or Services or any service, content, feature, or
              product offered through our Sites or Services, with or without notice; charge fees in connection with the
              use of our Sites and Services; modify and/or waive any fees charged in connection with our Sites or
              Services; and/or offer opportunities to some or all users of our Sites or Services. You agree that we
              shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of
              our Sites or Services, or any service, content, feature, or product offered through our Sites or
              Services.</span></p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of the paragraphs of these Terms operates
              separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the
              remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.</span></p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Terms constitute the complete terms and
              conditions agreed between you and Topstep and supersede all prior agreements relating to the subject
              matter of the Terms, whether verbal or written.</span></p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If any provision of the Terms is found to be
              invalid or ineffective, it shall be replaced by a provision whose meaning is as close as possible to the
              invalid provision. The invalidity or ineffectiveness of one provision shall not affect the validity of the
              other provisions. No past or future practice established between the parties and no custom maintained in
              general or in the industry relating to the subject matter of the performance, which is not expressly
              referred to in the Terms, shall be applied and no rights and obligations shall be derived from them for
              the parties; in addition, they shall not be taken into account in the interpretation of manifestations of
              the will of the parties.</span></p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we fail to insist that you perform any of your
              obligations under these Terms, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so,
              that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to
              comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that
              will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.</span></p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Topstep may assign any claim from these Terms or
              any agreement to a third party without your consent. You agree that Topstep may, as the assignor, transfer
              its rights and obligations under these Terms or any agreement or parts thereof to a third party. You are
              not authorized to transfer or assign your rights or obligations under these Terms or any agreements or
              parts thereof.</span></p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may terminate these Terms at any time without
              notice, and accordingly may deny you access to our Sites and Services, if in our sole judgment you fail to
              comply with any term or provision of these Terms. The obligations and liabilities of the parties incurred
              prior to the termination date shall survive the termination of these Terms for all purposes.</span></p>
          <h2 class="p4" style="text-align: left;">30. Acceptance of and Modifications to These Terms</h2>
